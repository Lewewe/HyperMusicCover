/**
 * The lyric that ships with the file being played.
 *
 * Every other route in this module asks somebody else what this song's words are - the player,
 * a provider module, a catalogue keyed by an id or by a name. For music sitting on the phone
 * none of that is necessary and none of it is as good: the file itself carries the lyric, it is
 * the lyric the person chose to keep with it, and reading it cannot pick the wrong song the way
 * a search can.
 *
 * Measured 2026-09-22 on this device, over Salt Player's library: 2020 audio files, 1903 of them
 * with a `.lrc` of the same name beside them, and the ones without - 音频怪物 - 典狱司 among them
 * - carrying a timed lyric inside the file instead, as an ID3 USLT frame. So both forms are read,
 * and between them there is very little left for the network to do.
 *
 * SystemUI can read all of it without asking: MANAGE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE and READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE
 * are both granted and SYSTEM_FIXED, so this is an ordinary file read from an ordinary path.
