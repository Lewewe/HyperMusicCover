/**
 * Keeps a window's PassBlur texture at the scale SurfaceFlinger draws it at.
 *
 * The background behind the notification shade and the control centre is a PassBlur:
 * SurfaceFlinger draws the home screen into a SurfaceTexture and the shade's window samples it.
 * ViewRootImpl keeps two scales for it, both persist.sys.background_blur_scale (0.25) to start:
 * mTexScale, the texture's size and the scale the window samples it at, and mDrawSfScale, the
 * scale SurfaceFlinger is told to draw at. mTexScale only ever goes up; getReqSfScale brings
 * mDrawSfScale back down.
 *
 * On the lock screen both go to 1.0 - the clock's container (clock_container_style1) asks for a
 * full-size texture when it is attached, and the renderer asks for 1.0 while the lock screen's
 * notifications are up. Leaving the lock screen, the renderer asks for 0.25 again and gets it, the
 * texture stays full size, and SurfaceFlinger's quarter-size picture in its top left corner is
 * sampled as the whole screen: the home screen magnified four times behind the panels. Seen on a
 * tester's Xiaomi 17 Ultra (OS4.0.0.28, magazine_c clock) and caught with a diagnostic build
 * (2026-10-01); aligning the two after getReqSfScale ended it.
 *
 * The texture scale is brought down to the draw scale and the texture resized, the same way
 * ViewRootImpl resizes it itself. A view that wants 1.0 again raises both together, as before.
