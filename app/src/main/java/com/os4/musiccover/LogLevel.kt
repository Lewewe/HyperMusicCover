 * How much the module logs, in every process it is loaded into.

 * process reads that group through its own framework handle and follows changes live (Xp). The
 * levels follow HyperLyric's (github.com/limczhh/HyperLyric, GPL-3.0): 普通 keeps what a bug
 * report needs - what loaded, what failed, what the user did - and 详细 adds the per-frame and
 * per-message chatter, which at its loudest was ~9 lines a second of one guard.
