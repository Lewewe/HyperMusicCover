/**
 * The lock screen's host for full-screen immersive pages - what every {@link ImmersiveScene}
 * shares, so that a new kind of page is a scene and nothing else.
 *
 * The flow, the way ColorOS 16's lock screen island does it and the way the music's island opens
 * the cover here:
 *
 *   ready    a scene says it has a page (高德 navigating). The host puts its slot into the lock
 *            screen window and, on the first lock screen shown, has the scene prepare its page
 *            there, hidden - so the tap that opens it finds it already drawn. The page is let go
 *            UNLOCKED_RELEASE_MS after an unlock and prepared again on the next lock screen: an
 *            app drawing its page in a SurfaceControlViewHost goes on drawing it for as long as
 *            it is held, and unlocked nobody sees it. The next lock screen starts with the
 *            screen going off, so it is prepared in the doze, well before the wake. The lock
 *            screen stays held for an open page meanwhile (sLetGo), so the clock sleeps small.
 *   open     the scene's focus island is tapped open (LockIslands.release): the island turns
 *            into its notification row, the page goes up behind the lock screen, the clock goes
 *            small and the wallpaper's cut-out goes (Main.onImmersive). Pulled back into its
 *            island (LockIslands.recapture), all of that is undone. It stays open across an
 *            unlock, as the cover does, until it is pulled back or the scene stops being ready.
 *
 * Opening and closing on the lit lock screen crossfade the page with what is under it, over the
 * cover's own crossfade (Main.fadeMsFor the clock's response, eased out the same way), so the
 * page arrives with the clock. Closed, the clock starts home at once and the page fades out with
 * it; turned round half way, the fade turns from where it is. Everything else - an unlock, the
 * doze, the shade over an app - is a cut, as it always was: those go with the lock screen's own
 * motion, and a page fading there would be one left behind.
 *
 * The page is blurred above and below the band it keeps its information in (EdgeBlurView,
 * ImmersiveScene.sharpBand), which is where the clock and the cards sit over it.
 *
 * Handing over to the cover and back, which is what an exchange between the music's island and
 * the page's island is (reported 2026-09-29: the wallpaper showed through between the two):
 *   - page closing onto the cover: the cover is composed and pushed to the wallpaper process
 *     and only then starts in, 60-120ms after the tap; a page that fades at once has half gone
 *     by then and shows the plain wallpaper. So the page holds until the wallpaper says the
 *     cover is on its way (Main's op wpart, coverShown) - COVER_WAIT_MS at most - and then goes
 *     on a curve that keeps it until the cover is mostly in.
 *   - page opening over the cover: the cover leaving the wallpaper waits until the page covers
 *     it (coverOffHoldMs, read by CoverPush); a tap back in before then drops that leave, and
 *     the cover never went.
 *
 * One scene is open at a time. The cover and a page are one backdrop between them, and the later
 * one is the one shown: cover mode starting while a page is open makes the page yield - it fades
 * out onto the cover as a close does, though its island stays open - and cover mode ending gives
 * it back. That is what an interrupted exchange needs: turned round mid-morph, the music's island
 * goes up into the cover and back without the page's row ever being taken back in, and the
 * cover's card sat over the map instead of its blurred cover (filmed 2026-09-29). The clock is
 * held while either wants it (Main.clockHeld).
 *
 * Where the page is seen: the lit lock screen, and the FULL-SCREEN doze - the lock screen dimmed -
 * under a black veil, because the doze dims the keyguard's views and a page under the window is
 * not one of them. Not the plain doze (a clock on black), and not the shade pulled over an
 * unlocked phone, which is the same window. The slot sits at the bottom of the shade window's
 * root, under every keyguard view; a SurfaceView in it at its default z-order is composited below
 * the window altogether, which is ColorOS's arrangement (its SurfaceView is at relative z -2).
 *
 * The doze: some ten seconds in, the AOD puts the display in DOZE_SUSPEND, where the panel repeats
 * its last frame and new ones never reach it. A DRAW_WAKE_LOCK lifts it back to DOZE while it is
 * held (see LockLyrics.drawStill, which does this per lyric line). Each lift is that recipe, not a
 * fixed hold: take the lock, wait for DOZE, draw one frame, let go when it is committed (lift). A
 * page drawn here lifts when it redraws, which is when its picture changes - ColorOS's AOD does
 * the same, per view invalidation (AODDisplayUtil.AODViewClient). A page drawn in another process
 * never says when it changes, so for a scene that asks, the display is let up on a beat.
 *
 * Probe: {@code op immersive [--es id <scene>] [--es do state|open|close|arm|disarm|rowtap]}.
