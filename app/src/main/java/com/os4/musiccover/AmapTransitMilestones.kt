/**
 * Which milestone a bus or subway trip is at - what 高德 tells ColorOS outright (the entity's
 * `status`) and never says here. Worked out of what it does say: which leg its card is on, and
 * how many stops that leg has left.
 *
 *   - a ride first seen with all its stops still ahead is 候车 (2), until the first one goes by;
 *   - each stop that goes by is 当前站 (5) for [DWELL_MS], then 下一站 (3), and 下一站即终点 (4)
 *     before the leg's last stop;
 *   - 高德's card leaving a ride for the next leg is that ride reaching its end: 到达换乘站 (6)
 *     when another ride follows, else 到站 (7) - held up ([Hold]) because 高德 has already moved
 *     on, where ColorOS would still be showing it: a subway's 到站 for the five minutes
 *     GaoDePtRideCodeDeferBindManager holds the walk after it back (cut short when 高德's own
 *     walking navigation comes up, as a walking entity cuts it on ColorOS), the others for
 *     [DWELL_MS];
 *   - a trip's last leg being a ride, its 到站 is when 高德 says the leg is over.
 *
 * No Android in here, so it can be tried on a computer (AmapTransitCardTest); the times are
 * whatever clock the caller gives.
