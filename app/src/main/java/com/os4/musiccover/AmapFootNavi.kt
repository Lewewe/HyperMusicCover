/**
 * 高德's own walking navigation, started from here instead of by hand.
 *
 * A bus or subway trip in 高德 has a walk at the front and one at the back, and each of those
 * walks has a navigation of its own - the 「步行导航 ▸」 beside it in the trip's page. The
 * 「开始导航」 at the bottom right starts the transit navigation only, so reaching the walk's own
 * navigation takes a second tap somewhere else. ColorOS starts it for you: its walking card's
 * button is routed to `BaiduPublicTransportRouterActivity`-style handler that, before opening the
 * map app, calls its own `beginWalkAndBikeInTripNaviOnSilentClick` with the walk's entity - and
 * that only works there because the OPPO build of 高德 hands SceneService a
 * `GaoDeWalkingAndCyclingIntentEntity` for the walk. This phone's 高德 never sends one (the same
 * script that leaves `bizBegin(10200)` alone), so the same thing is done through 高德's own entry
 * instead of a card of our own:
 *
 *   IFootNaviService.startNaviPage(PageBundle)      - com.autonavi.minimap.route.foot.impl
 *     GeoPoint end = bundle.getObject("endPoint");  - IOpenRoutePage's own keys
 *     GeoPoint start = bundle.getObject("startPoint");   // null -> the current location
 *     String name = bundle.getString("endPointName");
 *
 * The start point is filled in from the latest fix by 高德 itself, and it refuses a walk longer
 * than 100 km, so all this has to hand over is where the walk ends and what it is called.
 *
 * Nothing here draws anything: the navigation it opens is 高德's, and AmapNavScene already renders
 * that page (it was checked against 高德's own walking navigation on 2026-09-29).
